  An extremely walkable and friendly city. Don't worry about not speaking French
  as almost everyone here will be able to speak to you in English. I like letting
  people know I don't speak French by starting every conversation with:

  > Bonjour, hello

  Very rarely need to use public transportation so long as you stay in Le
  Plateau-Mont-Royal area as you can walk everywhere. You can drink in public
  parks so long as you also have food with you.
